# Desktop qualification

[English (US)](DESKTOP_TESTING.md) | [Português (Brasil)](DESKTOP_TESTING.pt-BR.md)

This guide covers the reproducible desktop work in beta step 3. Xmonad running inside Xephyr exercises a real window manager and X server. Xephyr hosted by Xvfb uses software rendering; these results do not qualify a GPU driver, physical monitor, or tear-free scanout. Physical hotplug in step 2 and hardware desktop qualification in step 3 remain open.

## Run the isolated baseline

Install the pinned Rust toolchain, a C linker, GHC with the `xmonad` and `xmonad-contrib` libraries, Xvfb, Xephyr, `xprop`, `xdpyinfo`, `xrandr`, and standard Linux utilities including `timeout`, `getconf`, and `sha256sum`. Run from the repository root. The runner allocates both displays automatically and starts a private Xmonad configuration; it can run from a Wayland session or without a desktop.

```sh
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
cargo build --release --locked --bin compust --example desktop_probe
mkdir -p artifacts
tools/desktop-check.sh artifacts/desktop-present present
tools/desktop-check.sh artifacts/desktop-direct direct
```

Each report directory must be new. Omitting the mode selects `present`; `--help` describes the command. Set `XVFB` and `XEPHYR` to alternative executable paths to test another server build, including XLibre's Xephyr. They do not select your existing desktop display. `SECONDS_PER_PHASE` accepts 1–30 seconds and defaults to 10. Run measurements sequentially, with other builds and benchmarks stopped.

Both configurations use `opacity = 100`, `fade_ms = 0`, `blur_radius = 0`, and `max_fps = 120`. The [Present configuration](../tools/desktop/compust.toml) uses `vsync = true`; the [direct configuration](../tools/desktop/compust-direct.toml) uses `vsync = false`. These results therefore exclude fade, translucency, and blur costs.

The probe checks managed tiling, override-redirect popup removal, EWMH fullscreen and restoration, switching to an empty workspace and back, 32 rapid create/map/destroy sequences, and a surviving window's redraw. Each scene checks actual overlay pixels. The runner also requires a successful compositor exit after SIGTERM. Display startup waits for `-displayfd`, while selection, window-manager, and scene readiness use X11 notifications with deadlines.

After two seconds of warmup, the probe measures an idle phase and a phase with a large opaque window alternating red and blue at a requested 60 updates per second. It records Compust, Xephyr, the Xvfb host, Xmonad, and probe CPU separately, with RSS at each phase's endpoints. CPU percentages use one core as 100%; a zero value means no CPU ticks were observed during that interval. Endpoint RSS values are not a long-running leak test.

In `present` mode, the active phase must receive multiple compositor Present completions. `frames.csv` contains server UST timestamps, MSC values, serials, and completion modes. Compute intervals only between successive records in the same phase. These are software completion timings, not input-to-display latency or physical refresh measurements.

In `direct` mode, the probe requires overlay Damage notifications during activity and rejects any compositor Present completions. `frames.csv` has only its header: there is no Present pacing measurement for direct copying. Damage counts establish redraw activity, not displayed frame rate. This probe still requires the server's Present extension so it can detect an incorrectly selected path; production Compust can run without that extension.

## Keep evidence attributable

The report includes server extensions, output geometry, CPU model, kernel, Rust and window-manager versions, the exact configuration, process measurements, scene captures, logs, and executable hashes. `commit.txt` identifies the base revision; `worktree.txt`, `source.patch`, and `source-sha256.txt` record local changes. A dirty run must be described as that revision plus those changes, not as a clean test of the commit.

Retain raw CSV files alongside any summary. Store only captures of isolated test windows in local artifacts; review logs before sharing them. The [earlier records](benchmarks/2026-10-03/) contain the first Present baselines at `1409a919dd0c91ccaad3fbb323df4b33628554fd`. Their archived metadata is less complete than the current runner's report.

## Recorded baseline: 2026-10-03

Four sequential runs passed on CachyOS, Linux 7.2.8-arch1-1, an AMD Ryzen 5 5600GT, Rust 1.95.0, and Xmonad 0.18.1. Each used one 1280×800×24 Xephyr screen hosted by Xorg Xvfb 21.1.24. The nested servers were Xorg 21.1.24 and XLibre 25.1.9. RandR reported a virtual refresh rate of 0.00 Hz; the workload requested 60 updates per second.

The tested base was `cb0796c8e42a95d3c80ab11c557b75809f791d43` plus the [recorded probe/runner changes](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/source.patch) and copied direct-mode configuration. The [source hashes](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/source-sha256.txt) matched across all four runs. The production compositor binary's SHA-256 was `5452d6f590502b1437b8064521d8d82dddd1095d959078fe61ae2d340969a005`, identical to the earlier recorded binary. The source patch excludes the new configuration file; each run archives its actual `compust.toml` separately.

Each active phase lasted approximately 10 seconds and issued 600 updates. CPU values below are percentages of one core; RSS is in KiB. Links lead to the underlying process measurements, with other evidence in the same directory.

| Nested server / path | Active Compust CPU | Active Xephyr CPU | Compust RSS before → after | Present completions / Damage notifications |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [Xorg / Present](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xorg-present/processes.csv) | 0.4% | 10.5% | 3,820 → 3,820 | 599 / 599 |
| [Xorg / direct](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xorg-direct/processes.csv) | 0.3% | 13.3% | 3,876 → 3,876 | 0 / 600 |
| [XLibre / Present](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xlibre-present/processes.csv) | 0.4% | 13.7% | 3,888 → 3,888 | 599 / 599 |
| [XLibre / direct](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xlibre-direct/processes.csv) | 0.2% | 9.4% | 3,880 → 3,880 | 0 / 600 |

All measured processes recorded zero idle CPU ticks and unchanged RSS endpoints in both phases. Each Present run observed one completion during idle after warmup; each direct run observed no idle Damage notifications. The Xvfb host used 2.9–4.5% active CPU and the probe 0.3–0.4%, recorded separately. This probe observes Damage in both modes, so the measurements include that observation overhead. These single runs are baselines, not evidence that one server or mode is faster.

| Present intervals, active phase | Median | p95 | Maximum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| [Xorg, 598 intervals](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xorg-present/frames.csv) | 16.669 ms | 17.740 ms | 18.728 ms |
| [XLibre, 598 intervals](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/xlibre-present/frames.csv) | 16.669 ms | 17.807 ms | 18.890 ms |

Intervals are successive UST differences divided by 1,000; median and p95 use the nearest-rank convention. All recorded completion modes were `COPY`. Direct-mode frame files contain no timing samples.

Two negative checks swapped only the configurations in temporary runner copies. Expecting Present with a direct compositor [failed for missing completions](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/rejected-present/probe.log); expecting direct copying with a Present compositor [failed for unexpected completions](benchmarks/2026-10-03/presentation/rejected-direct/probe.log). Both exited with status 1, while the four matching runs exited successfully after checking pixels and SIGTERM shutdown.

Xmonad's logs retain `BadAtom` and `getWindowAttributes` diagnostics also present in the earlier archives. Their cause was not resolved in this increment; all asserted scene checks passed. Xephyr's gamma-query warning and virtual refresh rate do not qualify physical display behavior. Hardware hotplug, GPU drivers, decorated/reparenting window managers, and effect-heavy performance remain unverified here.

## Complete the hardware gates

Use a dedicated Xorg or XLibre test session with the intended window manager. Record the exact commit and build hashes, distribution, server version, GPU and driver, window-manager version/configuration, `compust --diagnose`, `xrandr --verbose`, and compositor configuration. Stop the existing compositor before starting Compust; retain the command needed to restore it. Do not run the desktop probe against a normal working session: it creates and destroys windows and switches workspaces.

Repeat the lifecycle, menus, fullscreen, and workspace scenarios with actual applications. Add decorated/reparenting windows, wallpaper changes, session shutdown, fades, and translucent windows with blur enabled. Record which scenarios passed, their reproductions, and logs for every failure. Xmonad's nested checks do not qualify another window manager.

For step 2, record connector names, resolutions, refresh rates, and the monitor layout before and after physically disconnecting/reconnecting each external display. Exercise layout and resolution changes, including windows spanning outputs, in both presentation modes. Verify continued redraws and correct restored pixels after each transition. Virtual CRTC disable/enable is already covered in automation and does not substitute for these connector tests.

For step 3, measure idle and active CPU for both Compust and the X server, memory trends over repeated operations, and Present intervals where available. Include workload duration, window count, opacity/blur settings, and monitor refresh rates. Compare picom only with an identified version/backend and equivalent scenes and effects. Publish evidence for each server/window-manager/driver combination before declaring it supported; beta distribution remains gated on that declared scope.
